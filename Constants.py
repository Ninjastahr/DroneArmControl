#   There isn't a way to create true constants in Python, so please don't modify these in other classes
#   Again: DO NOT MODIFY THESE VARIABLES

#   Base constants:
CONST_BASE_SWIVEL_CHANNEL = 1;
CONST_BASE_ANGLE_START = 160;
CONST_BASE_MIN_PWM = 2400;
CONST_BASE_MAX_PWM = 9200;
CONST_BASE_MAX_ANGLE = 180;

#   Joint 1 constants:
CONST_JOINT_1_CHANNEL = 2;
CONST_JOINT_1_ANGLE_START = 30;
